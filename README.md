# Hybrid APP Authentication with ID Tokens

## Introduction
This code sample demonstrates how to implement authentication using ID Tokens in a [Webflow Hybrid App](https://docs.developers.webflow.com/data/docs/hybrid-apps). It provides a starting point for setting up authentication middleware, server-side logic, and integrating with a Designer Extension frontend.

## Getting Started
To run the application, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Install dependencies by running `npm install`.
3. Configure environment variables as needed. See the guide for instructions.
4. Start the application by running `npm run dev`.

## Environment Variables
Ensure the following environment variables are configured:

- `WEBFLOW_CLIENT_ID`: Description of WEBFLOW_CLIENT_ID environment variable.
- `WEBFLOW_CLIENT_SECRET`: Description of WEBFLOW_CLIENT_SECRET environment variable.
- `APP_TOKEN`: Description of APP_TOKEN environment variable.
- `PORT`: Description of PORT environment variable.
